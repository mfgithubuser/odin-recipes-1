    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
        Chocolate chip cookies are a classic treat beloved for their crisp edges,
        soft centers, and rich bursts of melted chocolate in every bite. They’re
        simple to make and perfect for sharing with family and friends.

        <p>
        This recipe balances sweetness and chewiness, creating cookies that are golden
        brown on the outside while staying soft and gooey inside. Enjoy them warm
        with a glass of milk or as a snack any time of day.

            <li>2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>3/4 cup packed brown sugar</li>

            <li>Optional: 1 cup chopped nuts (walnuts or pecans)</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, beat the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until creamy and smooth.</li>
            <li>Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
            <li>Gradually add the dry ingredients into the wet mixture, mixing until just combined.</li>
            <li>Fold in the chocolate chips (and nuts, if using).</li>
            <li>Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart.</li>
            <li>Bake for 9–11 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown but the centers are still soft.</li>
            <li>Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        </ol>
