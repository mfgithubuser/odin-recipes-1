# Odin Recipes

This is my first project for The Odin Project.  
Itâ€™s a basic recipe website built with HTML.

By completing it I will demonstrate skills like:
- Setting up a GitHub repository
- Using Git for version control
- Writing basic HTML
- Structuring a simple multi-page website
- Linking between pages and adding images
